This study explores how socioeconomic status (SES) may buffer or exacerbate the impact of persistent maternal smoking exposure on mental health outcomes in young adulthood. Using data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, we modeled maternal smoking trajectories and examined their relationship with mental health service utilization, testing for moderation by SES. Findings highlight the importance of early interventions targeted to high-risk families and the potential protective effects of higher socioeconomic resources.
