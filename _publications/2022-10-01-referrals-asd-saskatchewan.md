### Abstract

**Background**: The Alvin Buckwold Child Development Program (ABCDP) serves Northern and Central Saskatchewan as a tertiary diagnostic centre for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but data is lacking on referrals and diagnostic outcomes.

**Objectives**: To assess whether referral patterns (referring clinician type and referral content) are associated with ASD diagnostic outcomes.

**Design/Methods**: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using patient data from January 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2018. Predictor variables included the referring clinician and concerns identified in referral letters, specifically the DSM-5 criteria A (social communication) and B (repetitive behaviors). Speech-language pathologist (SLP) reports were reviewed for social communication concerns. Simple logistic regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RR) and odds ratios (OR).

**Results**: Among 527 patients included, 365 received an ASD diagnosis. Referrals by physiotherapists and SLPs were significantly more likely to lead to a diagnosis. Concerns in SLP reports about social communication were also linked to a higher likelihood of diagnosis. Using referrals with no criteria as a reference group, referrals with criteria A concerns were approximately 2.7 times more likely to lead to an ASD diagnosis.

**Conclusion**: Referrals made by SLPs and PTs and those raising concerns for social communication or criteria A are significantly associated with an ASD diagnosis. These findings may support better triaging and resource allocation in ASD assessments.
